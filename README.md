### This RESTful API uses FastAPI instead of the traditional framework suite of Flask or Django since the project mainly focuses on just getting an API up and running. This framework has a lot of optimizations which allow for lesser response time.

### The RESTful API comes along with the standard query parameters such as pagination and limits, allowing the user to use multiple parameters as well. This test API has also been documented for the user's convenience.

### This was made as a proof of skill in FastAPI, the code is meant to be lightweight and efficient while showcasing its API features. A portfolio project on making API using FastAPI for Upwork
